Episode 1 is a summary of episodes 1-16 of the original Japanese version (64 episodes). This is why it's only 49 episodes (64 minus 15).<br />However, after FUNimation released the ""US version"" of GT (49 episodes), they decided it was a good idea to also release the 16 episodes they left out in their ""US version"". Hence ""The Lost Episodes"" were born. These episodes are nothing more than the ""US version"" of the original first 16 episodes of the ""Japanese version"" of GT. Therefore, if you combine ""The Lost Episodes"" with the ""US version"" and discard the first episode of the ""US version"", you will get the 64 episodes that the ""Japanese Version"" of GT consists of, and you will have a complete version of Dragon Ball GT in English.If this does not make sense to you, please contact FUNimation for more information. :P<b>A note about the German TV release of the Dragonball GT series (the special is buyable only on DVD)</b><br />The channel RTL 2 did not air 13 episodes.

2542,Sailor Moon Sailor Stars,1996-03-09,1997-02-08,TV Series,34,6.4,7.38,"Sailor Stars is divided into two arcs. The first arc is relatively short with six episodes that re-introduce the previous season's villain, Queen Nehellenia, as well as the four Outer Senshi, who meet her for the first time. Sailor Pluto's arrival together with Sailor Saturn meant that a new and more powerful enemy is approaching the Solar System who has distorted the timeline already as Sailor Pluto explained to the inner senshi group. These episodes originated as filler to allow Takeuchi time to begin her new story-arc; afterward the season follows the manga. The second arc is relatively long, and is the basis of the Sailor Stars theme which focusses mainly on this new unknown enemy's eventual arrival on Earth. Its plot branches out to introduce new characters and even new Sailor Senshi from other planets, including the Sailor Starlights, Princess Kakyuu, and Chibi Chibi. As in the manga, Chibiusa returns to her own time after the final battle with Nehellenia, but is not a participant in the climatic events of this story arc. The sailor senshi discover that the other sailors - the Sailor Starlights, are actually running away from another threat and they are very dedicated to finding their princess of their own Solar System, which was taken over by this main threat. The sailor starlights believe that their princess is actually The Light of Hope who can save them from running away and fight back against this new enemy - hence their search for their princess takes them to search through the people on planet Earth, the last realm untouched by the enemy. The main threat turns out to be Sailor Galaxia, queen of an organization called Shadow Galactica and a powerful former sailor senshi - the most powerful sailor senshi of the whole galaxy. Sailor Galaxia is forced to rule the galaxy by her own evil within herself. By collecting true star seeds (the equivalent of the manga's Sailor Crystals) from Sailor Senshi throughout the galaxy, her powers increases.

6784,Fate/stay night Unlimited Blade Works,2010-01-23,,Movie,1,6.73,7.47,"* Based on the second route of the Fate/Stay Night erotic visual novel by Type-Moon.High school junior student Emiya Shirou is twice an orphan. Once, a great fire that destroyed more than a hundred homes took the lives of his biological parents. He was then adopted by the man who saved him from that inferno, a man who called himself a magus; however, after a few years, that man, too, died. Shirou was left with a home, the dream to become a superhero, and some extremely limited knowledge of magecraft, the art practised in secret by magi all over the world. Now, unbeknownst to him, the city he lives in, Fuyuki City, is to become the place where a great war will be fought in secret by magi like the man who adopted him.For this great war, seven magi shall gather together in Fuyuki. Each magus becomes a Master, and each Master summons a Servant, a spirit of a mighty hero of the past that, due to their almost almighty powers in life and to the faith people have put in them through the times, ascend to a higher level of existence, outside of time. Together, Master and Servant fight against the other teams for the possession of the Holy Grail, a relic said to be almighty and grant any wish, no matter how great. However, in order to allow the winning Master and Servant to be granted one wish each, all other teams must be defeated, and the enemy Servants annihilated. That war is thus called the Holy Grail War. The Holy Grail War has happened four times so far, and the fifth one is about to take place.The hero each Servant was in life has fame, and as such their lives are well-known. By knowing the true name of a Servant, one clearly also knows its strengths and weaknesses; thus, it is the custom for each team to hide the identity of their Servant and try to find out those of the other ones. To better hide the identity, the Servants are usually referred to by their classes, Saber, Archer, Lancer, Rider, Berserker, Caster, and Assassin.One night, Shirou witnesses a fight between two servants, Archer and Lancer. To preserve the secrecy of the War, Lancer mortally wounds him. However, a girl who up until now was just a classmate of his and the school idol, Toosaka Rin, saves his life by pouring all the magical energy from a pendant into fixing his heart. However, he gets attacked by Lancer again, and this time Rin will not be able to save him. Just as he's about to die for good, he unwittingly summons Saber, who promptly drives Lancer off. The powerful sword user turns to Shirou and asks whether he is her Master, much to his bewilderment. In spite of being just a rank amateur, he now has to fight a war between powerful and experienced magi. He and Saber decide to agree with a partnership with Rin, but Rin's servant, Archer, seems to despise him utterly for a reason. Can this partnership hold when one of the four members seems so absolutely keen on getting rid of another?— written by Hinoe"

But this criminal did perform one single act of kindness in not stepping on a spider in a forest.
