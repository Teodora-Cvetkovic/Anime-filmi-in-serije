Due to an evolutionary breakthrough, the &quot;Solid Vision&quot; system is now able to provide Duel Monsters with mass. Yuuya Sakaki is Yuusho Sakaki&#039;s son, the latter being the founder of You Show Duel School in Miami City. Yuusho insists that duels are not a tool of war, but rather are to bring smiles to people and thus introduced the concept of Entertainment Dueling. However, at the height of his fame, Yuusho disappears and fails to attend his duel with Strong Ishijima, the Action Duel champion. Although scarred by this sudden leave, Yuuya vows to become an Entertainment Duelist like his father. Several years later, in the midst of a battle with Strong Ishijima, Yuuya&#039;s desperation to win brings forth a miracle. His pendant begins glowing, turning his cards into Pendulum Cards, which enables him to perform a Pendulum Summon—a summoning method unknown to the world and himself—gaining him fame overnight. As a result, Reiji Akaba, CEO of Leo Corporation and founder of the elite Leo Duel School, starts producing new Pendulum Cards to incorporate Pendulum Summoning into the system. Thus, the mysteries that surround Pendulum Summoning and Yuuya&#039;s father start to unravel, and Yuuya learns bit by bit what it takes to become an Entertainment Duelist.

Due to an evolutionary breakthrough, the &quot;Solid Vision&quot; system is now able to provide Duel Monsters with mass.<br />
<br />
Yuuya Sakaki is Yuusho Sakaki&#039;s son, the latter being the founder of You Show Duel School in Miami City. Yuusho insists that duels are not a tool of war, but rather are to bring smiles to people and thus introduced the concept of Entertainment Dueling. However, at the height of his fame, Yuusho disappears and fails to attend his duel with Strong Ishijima, the Action Duel champion. Although scarred by this sudden leave, Yuuya vows to become an Entertainment Duelist like his father.<br />
<br />
Several years later, in the midst of a battle with Strong Ishijima, Yuuya&#039;s desperation to win brings forth a miracle. His pendant begins glowing, turning his cards into Pendulum Cards, which enables him to perform a Pendulum Summon&mdash;a summoning method unknown to the world and himself&mdash;gaining him fame overnight. As a result, Reiji Akaba, CEO of Leo Corporation and founder of the elite Leo Duel School, starts producing new Pendulum Cards to incorporate Pendulum Summoning into the system. Thus, the mysteries that surround Pendulum Summoning and Yuuya&#039;s father start to unravel, and Yuuya learns bit by bit what it takes to become an Entertainment Duelist.<br />

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
In the case of the spoilers, I will be vague to try not to completely ruin all the surprises for someone who does choose to watch this series. That said, a lot of the big events of the story really have to be brought up at least in some form to explain why its so bad. <br />
<br />
I imagine, especially for people who have not watched the series the whole way through, a 1/10 grade might come across as kind of extreme for this series. Technically speaking, it does have a functional and even expansive plotline, a good amount of buildup especially early

          <span style="display: none;" id="review244007">
        on, and a lot of actually kind of interesting character premises. The problem here is that this is a series where the appeal of the early parts is the mysteries and concepts that get established, that you look forward to being resolved later. The early parts of Arc-V, if there was proper payoff, would really not be all that bad, its just the series takes a downright insulting approach to playing off said buildup. I can&#039;t tell you how many times I thought the series was building up to something cool, only for the result to just come out as something completely pathetic and anti-climactic.<br />
<br />
Before we get into the plot, I figure I will throw a mention to the visuals of the series because it really needs to be said, they&#039;re bad. The very conspicuous looking CG appearance of most significant monsters in the series is pretty awkward, and the visual design of most cards really leaves a lot to be desired. Many characters just have monsters where their designs all just feel like chrome machine-like things, and get very repetitive in their designs very fast. They also just turn into horrible clusters of many colors and sticking out pieces that really just gets kind of ugly and unpleasant to look at. The designs that aren&#039;t this are usually very cutesy cartoon stuff which is fairly subjective in terms of appeal, but personally I found it pretty awful. The animation quality is occasionally decent, but there are frequently episodes where you can tell the bare minimum budget or effort was put forth to make it look good. Also, while this could be argued to be a problem with most modern Yu-gi-oh series, the amount of times the summon animations and chants of major monsters get repeated gets pretty aggravating, especially when due to the designs and mediocre CG they&#039;re usually not even cool the first time. I won&#039;t deny there are a few exceptions, Fluffals and Predator Plants coming to mind as monsters with actual cool concepts behind them. The problem is that they get fairly little screen time when compared to the massively played up four main dragons, which are some of the worse of the ugly machine-like designs I&#039;ve mentioned earlier and they only get worse with their evolved forms.<br />
<br />
The plot starts off by promising something an interdimensional war between different factions that use different methods of monster summoning. This is a fairly interesting basis, but we don&#039;t actually see the dimensions clash very much in battle, the most we see being that one dimension got defeated handily by another in a bunch of flashbacks. Aside from that, its basically just the main characters running around and solving other problem in whatever dimension they&#039;re currently in and not really addressing any sort of invasion or clash between forces. There are bits where it does happen, mostly in the early arcs, but its surprising and honestly kind of depressing how inactive the main antagonists of the series are for the majority of it. After some initial duels they do basically nothing other than send out fodder troops that don&#039;t accomplish anything until we meet their higher ups. The higher ups are universally pathetic and get easily trounced by the protagonist, and somehow end up buying into his stupid &quot;entertainment&quot; philosophy the show forces down our throats as hard as it possibly can. The most actually effective and fun villain is someone who is only very technically related to them, and while he serves as a decent overarching villain for his arc he is defeated in surprisingly casual fashion and then never mentioned again.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a bit more I could talk about with the plot, but before that something needs to be said about the characters. The show actually does not have a bad base for a lot of its characters, giving them fairly distinct personalities that from the one note they start from could be turned into something good. However, the show throws an obscene number of characters at the viewer, and frankly does a horrible job at managing them properly. The main character Yuya gets a ton of focus, and Yuzu, the lead girl, gets a lot up until she suddenly becomes a plot device who is never allowed to duel for the last 60 episodes. Other than that due to sheer number nobody really gets the development they need to evolve past their singular note, outside of arguably Shun who gets a respectable amount of character development. Even with him however, his growth as a character feels kind of rushed and the end of the series decides to treat him like absolute dirt, so if you bothered to get attached to the one character the show makes any attempt to make you care about other than its lead I promise you that you will be disappointed by the result.Arguably the most insulting examples are the comedic relief rival character, who based on him finally settling on a singular deck choice and starting to meld in with the protagonists, you would really think would be given a chance to show what he&#039;s worth. No, he literally never wins a duel on his own in the entire series, and the duels he wins on a team are against literal faceless fodder troops of the different dimensional factions. And the sad thing is if anything, I think he actually gets off better than a good number of characters because he&#039;s not hit by random brainwashing to love Yuya&#039;s stupid entertainment/smile philosophy. <br />
<br />
The real cream of the crap here though is Yuya himself, who on some level I get the idea behind. The whole concept was to have him be a very goofy character who had a rather childish philosophy of just thinking he could resolve things by making his monsters do silly things and make his dueling fun to watch. He did have a serious side in relation to his missing dad and you know, there was a point in the series it looks like its going to work out. At one point he duels a force of security guards and they&#039;re completely baffled by his fun and smiles solves everything philosophy, and they even take advantage of it when fighting him. As the series goes on, you would really think that they would force him to evolve past that and develop new ways of getting to people. No, instead the series gradually reconstructs said philosophy as apparently being not completely insane by having it literally solve the conflicts of entire factions on its own simply by Yuya having a &quot;fun&quot; duel in front of everyone. Its absolutely mind boggling how these conflicts which people that involved imprisonment and likely in at least a few cases death even if the show is too childish to show it are just resolved by some kid trying to be entertaining in front of a crowd. Frankly, he&#039;s not even entertaining and most of his better duels are carried entirely by his opponents, but no matter what everyone who duels him eventually comes to worship the ground Yuya walks on. As a result he never develops as a character, and is basically the same person in the final episode as he was in the first, just with a more broken deck.<br />
<br />
The thing with Yuya is the plot does try to do some interesting things with him beyond just his personality and &quot;fun and smiles&quot; brainwashing nonsense. There&#039;s the whole mystery of why there are four people with the same face, him being one of them, with chromatic robots that look kinda like dragons that the show says are dragons which react strangely and violently around each other. There are also four girls with the same face, with Yuzu being one of them, who are generally close to their counterpart Yuya equivalents. This is arguably the big mystery of the plot, and it has to be said, when its finally revealed the payoff looks kind of promising for a moment. Except the payoff takes absolutely no chance to use any of the qualities of each individual Yuya clone and instead we get a duel that goes on for a solid five episodes. Said five episodes are mind-numbingly repetitive, dull, and feel surprisingly lacking in climactic tension despite being something that recieved an obscene amount of buildup. The way it is finally resolved is absolutely pathetic and beyond anti-climactic, and  the whole time despite a situation that really would not warrant it every single character is basically worshiping Yuya for the entire fight. It even all centers around a monster who has one of the worst designs of any in the entire show, an absolute mess that shows all the low points of Yu-gi-oh&#039;s recent design direction. The whole thing is your big payoff for a show made entirely around buildup, and honestly comes across as downright insulting. Oh yeah and for the record, the way Yuzu and her clones are used comes across as insanely insulting to those characters.<br />
<br />
The show actually does not end there, and goes on for another 8 solid episodes. In those 8 episodes, Yuya duels in every single one of them with pretty much the entire universe worshiping him the whole time. Said duels are terrible and the story around them is also terrible, with the exception of one that is entirely decent because it gave screentime to a character that was sorely underused. The final one in particular is possibly the worst written duel in terms of actual &quot;action&quot; in the entire franchise, with absolutely miserable writing around it that makes Yuya and all other versions of him into considerably worse characters. The reason for all of this is something I really cannot avoid saying outright, because it is that stupid: These 8 episodes are entirely dedicated to preventing a calamity from happening again by making a baby smile. Its as bad as it sounds.<br />
<br />
There are plenty more things that could be said about Arc-V, but at its core its a series all about buildup to a grand climax where the payoff to said buildup is about as bad as it ever possibly could be. The journey there is full of characters who could have become something getting their potential squandered and then proceeding to worship the ground Yuya walks on. Yuya&#039;s childish and completely unbelievable philosophy becomes the center of the show and works miracles it has absolutely no right too, and comes across as a massive insult to the viewer&#039;s intelligence. It is not totally impossible to like Arc-V if you ignore the final stretch of 13 episodes and try to just think on how it was to watch it as it came out, but actually putting the plot together, it becomes clear no character was actually used properly. I&#039;d say don&#039;t ever watch this series unless you&#039;re some kind of masochist, but actually you know what? If you&#039;re an aspiring writer or critic, you actually probably should watch this series, as its a good example of everything not to do when writing a story.

    So Yugioh Arc-V is the fifth instalment into the Yugioh franchise, and, in my opinion, it is the best anime the franchise has to offer. (This is my first review so bear with me. I will also try to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but in order to explain what makes Arc-V so good, I will vaguely reference plot elements in the anime)<br />
<br />
Story<br />
 The beauty of Arc-V&#039;s story lies within its main character, Yuya Sakaki and his individual journey. Initially, Yuya seems like a standard shounen protagonst, who aspires to be the greatest Entertainment duelist, a duelist who brings smiles through dueling, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243572">
        as you experience his journey it should be clear this is anything but the case. He is forced to come to terms with the reality of his existence in order to reach his goal, which presents a genuinely unique take on the genre. I won&#039;t say anymore to avoid spoilers, but Yuya and his philosophies are tested multiple times over the course of the show by other characters and the nature of the storyline, and he will both progress and regress as a character, with compelling flaws which make him both believable and human.<br />
<br />
Through Yuya, Arc-V is also able to explore its themes in a fascinating way, The main theme of the show is that dueling should be utilised to make others smile, rather than using it for conflict. On the surface this seems basic, but the manner in which Arc-V presents this theme is what sets it apart from other anime displaying similar themes. Again, without spoiling too much, both ideologies are presented through Yuya which allows for a more engaging narrative, while also adding more depth to Yuya making him one of my favourite shounen protaganists out there.<br />
<br />
The setting and plot which accompanies Yuya&#039;s journey is also really engaging. At first, the storyline seems quite simple, and perhaps boring, but as the anime progresses, the story will start to unfold and get more complicated as it goes along, while also serving as direct contrast to Yuya&#039;s ideales. It will constantly raise questions, which only get answered late on in the show, adding to the mystery behind the story, and the unpredictable nature behind the story only enhances the mystery element.<br />
<br />
However, just like every other show, the story is not perfect. It has pacing issues, particularly around episodes 50-70 and 100-120, a rushed ending with messy presentation (but I do think the journey is more important than the ending itself), the plot is fairly  messy towards at it&#039;s climax, with a main villain who wasn&#039;t anywhere near as fleshed out as he should be, but overall Arc-V tells a strong, thematically rich and character driven story. <br />
<br />
I would also quickly like to touch upon the duels themselves, which are integral for a Yugioh anime. The duels for this show are great and extremely enjoyable for the most part. Even, if you do not play the game, the duels are still really engaging as a lot of them are unpredictable, and the music really adds to  intensity of the duel.<br />
<br />
Characters: <br />
I&#039;ve already talked about what makes Yuya such a good character, so lets talk about our main female lead, Yuzu who is great, even if her treatment in the latter half of the show is disappointing. Her development in the first half is very good and while she unfortunately does not get a chance to duel in the last 50 episodes, she remains the most important character in relation to the plot (alongside Yuya) until the very end and while many will say she becomes a damsel in distress (and in a physical sense, I can&#039;t deny this), it&#039;s easy to forget that she saves Yuya on numerous occasions in a more mental, emotional way even in the second half. If dueling was all there is too her and her development, I would be more annoyed, but it&#039;s not. Her personality and her other skill sets are far more valuable than dueling, which is why I love her from start to finish, and why she is my favourite female in Yugioh, even if she does not duel at the end.<br />
<br />
Our rival for the series, Akaba Reiji, is both a well written character and a unorthadox take on a rival. He is a spectacular duelist who as a result pushes Yuya to become a better duelist, but what makes him different to a traditional rival is his desire for Yuya to improve and surpass him. He can see Yuya&#039;s potential and pushes him to reach that potential to fulfill his own objectives, making his rivalry with Yuya one of my favourite aspects the show. <br />
<br />
Arc-V also has a great range of side characters, such as Sora, Shun, Selena, Yugo, Yuto, Dennis, and many more who each receive their own spotlight and development, with an absolutely compelling villain in the form of Yuri. However I&#039;ll be the first to say that Arc-V has too many characters for it&#039;s own good, with some rushed character arcs and some underutilised characters. If you are a long time Yugioh fan, you may see some familiar faces, but if not, that’s not to worry as they can be treated like new characters (there is no continuity). <br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
The music for this show is simply perfect. They really add to each scene and make the duels far more engaging and interesting. The VA’s for the show also do a great job, portraying the characters they play extremely well. <br />
<br />
Art and Animation: <br />
Unfortunately, the animation is not up to the same quality as the rest of the show. This is mainly due to Arc-v’s best animators being stolen for the new movie (Dark Side of Dimensions). However, I will say that the animation is very good for the important episodes, which makes it passable, but average at best. Thankfully, this is the least important aspect of a show for me.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
Overall, Arc-V is not just a great Yugioh show, but it is also a very good anime. It tells a shounen-esqe story of Yuya becoming the best entertainment duelist in a completely unorthadox way, a way in which a boy has to come to terms with and then overcome the reality of his existance,  accompanied by a brilliant cast of characters.  It is an unpredictable and unique story, and while it is messy, with pacing issues and plot holes, the positives heavily outweigh the negatives and it is absolutely a story worth spending 148 episodes on.<br />

    Good lord, I never thought I&#039;d see such a train wreck of a Yu-Gi-Oh show. So I will begin by prefacing this, this show is bad and the fact that it&#039;s bad has nothing to do with the hype it was receiving, that&#039;s just an excuse people use to defend garbage and they are more than likely lying through their rectum holes but fail to see that lie through their impenetrable condom of bias and utter ignorance. So let&#039;s just get to it because lord knows I&#039;m not gonna change anyone&#039;s opinion if they still think it&#039;s good because they&#039;ve drunkenly stumbled past the point

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246066">
        of no return.<br />
<br />
Story 2-<br />
I&#039;ve never had a story with so much build up that then proceeds to comically fall flat on its face while pretending to know what it is doing. It&#039;s like one of those songs that have an extremely large buildup only to lead into a pathetic drop that makes me wince. Let&#039;s analyse this by arcs shall we? Because this show is so long that this is the only real logical way to go through this.<br />
<br />
Pre-Arc League Championship 1-26<br />
When a lot of people point out the amazing writing at the start of the show, they don&#039;t mean here, this part was just your average 100+ episode show long buildup where it just introduces the characters while also throwing some mysteries here and there while also giving certain characters motives, it&#039;s really nothing special and is maybe a bit better than the start of Zexal. Overall this arc was fine, nothing really special about it other than building up the story around Shun.<br />
<br />
Arc League Championship 27-46<br />
This is the Arc that got many people invested into Arc-V as it introduces Heartland into the plot along with Academia the main villains, they were able to portray the threat that Academia pose fairly well in this Arc by showing that there was nowhere they wouldn&#039;t attack meaning that the safety if the characters were put into heavy jeopardy, this was also back when the Obelisk Force were an actual threat as characters would usually have to team up to defeat them, this arc also played with the Yu-Boys and the potential relation they had with each other, it was a good buildup arc and overall an extremely well written arc thanks to how most of the characters were portrayed.<br />
<br />
Friendship Cup 50-75<br />
This is where cracks began to appear in the show, this arc was mainly focused on providing hype for the legacy characters that were returning from other shows, this was fine but this also meant that tonnes of Arc-V characters were getting kicked out of the limelight. Overall this arc has very little progression, however they did introduce the dimensional war with this arc but it was unfortunately accompanied by the fact that all they did was fight in a tournament, however there was a nice prison arc which was fairly entertaining but they didn&#039;t even explore pass the city, yes that&#039;s right, the Synchro dimension was just reduced down to a city. There was this whole thing built up with Yuya and Yugo synchronising but it never happened again, so that was nice. This just felt like a boring excuse to use two cash cow characters while writing the story around them. <br />
<br />
Friendship Cup Finals 76-99<br />
This is where the arc began to really drag out (yes these two are pretty much the same arc) it was just simply tying up the stuff that was happening in the previous arc, there were some nice bits of information about Academia here and there but that was about it, the villain was the only star of this arc.<br />
<br />
Heartland City 100-125<br />
Good lord where to begin with this dreadful mess of an arc, it managed to make an arc with 25 episodes feel rushed and lazy, don&#039;t be fooled by the name either, next to none of it is focused on Heartland. Kaito is introduced as some sort of omnipotent God even though is personality is as boring as Reijis. Heartland began promising as it shows the gang the results of the war, allowing for interaction between those who have everything and those who have lost everything. It was a nice start until the jobbing lord Edo and the bipolar Tyler Sisters were brought into the fray and before you could say &quot;BUT YOU STILL TAKE THE DAMAGE!!!&quot; They were Egaod into oblivion and had a completely unnecessary change of heart. Then we move onto the Battle Beast, oh boy, I&#039;ve never seen something try so hard to mask it was filler while also making it seem so insulting, they did some pointless things such as carding Crow and Tsukikage, while also breaking Sawatari&#039;s duel disk, only for it all to be completely reversed later on, which made the arc even more insulting. They also made the Battle Beast into an ally, only for him to never show up again. All in all, this was filler the arc.<br />
<br />
Duel Academy 126-148<br />
This arc started off fairly hype, it had some amazing duels such as Yuri VS Yuya but it also had some head scratching duels such as Yuri VS Yusho in which Yusho gets fodderised which is the worst power balance that I&#039;ve ever had the misfortune of seeing all the Yu-boys then merged into the being known as Zarc which meant that watchers were finally going to get some plot tied up, there was the Arc- Area project which helped get some clarity on the Yu-girls who had now become Kotori 2.0 but that went nowhere. It then proceeded to the Zarc duels, which ended up being 5 episodes of &quot;I can job harder than you&quot; all leading up to a half baked conclusion in which Ray (The Yu-girls combo) was there but also not there penetrated Zarc with every bodies help except Sawatari&#039;s. We then get into the section where the dimension gets reset which involves an episode of everybody getting their memories back while Yuya fights Gong, Tsukikage and Sawatari. How did Reiji know about the past? Who knows. Certainly not the writers anyway. Yuya must then spend the rest of the show trying to make a baby smile by beating all of the lancers, truly riveting. Except for the fact that Gong beat Tsukikage and Sawatari (which had me triggered) and not him. They then shoehorn in a pointless Jack duel because Ono has a hard-on for 5D&#039;s and then proceeds to duel the &quot;rival&quot; Reiji, after all that garbage what is the ending we are presented with? The baby smiles and everything goes back to normal, oh except for the fact that all the Yu-boys are dead except Yuya and all of the Yu-girls are dead except Yuzu while Shun just looks on and smiles as his entire goal throughout the show is immediately crushed and he just takes it up the ass, the pendant is never explained and Reira is still a baby, there is no clarity on what happened to Roger and Barret, oh and Sawatari never wins a proper duel.<br />
<br />
This show is made much worse when you&#039;re having to watch it weekly, however I did enjoy getting treated like I&#039;m retarded throughout the show. People say that the show was going for a bittersweet ending but it is obvious that was not the case with the way everyone was acting, also bad writing doesn&#039;t make stuff bittersweet.<br />
<br />
Art 5-<br />
The art could be good at times but there were many animations issues along the way. During the Friendship Cup arc, many animators were taken away to work on DSOD, meaning they basically had the B-Team working on it, and this made it look like garbage. Near the end of the show one of the animators admitted that the staff were just telling them to do whatever meaning that they had no clue on what to draw, and it really shows as a lot of stuff near the end looks really stiff and lifeless. However when the art and animation looked good, it looked REALLY good, which made it all the more refreshing when they actual had a good animator on the job.<br />
<br />
Sound 9-<br />
Music is very subjective but what I will say is the Arc-V&#039;s consistency lied with its music, all the songs sounded like actual effort was put into it, the voice acting was also extremely well done as the actors were always able to convey the correct emotion for the correct situation.<br />
<br />
Characters 3-<br />
When people try and defend this shows characters (as shown on MAL) they only usually give 2 or 3 examples like they pretend the cast doesn&#039;t exist, well from a writing standpoint half of them don&#039;t but I will analyse the Lancers, some legacy characters, Yu-boys and girls, villains and some of the supporting cast.<br />
<br />
Yuya- The physical embodiment of egao, his only character development happens in the first few episodes where he stops being a little depressed clown. His berserk mode isn&#039;t even character development because it isn&#039;t part of his actual personality and just a wombo combo between him and Yuto. Other than that the show tries to pretend like his dueling style and knowledge of entertainment has evolved except that it hasn&#039;t and he literally acts the exact same throughout the entire show and people pretend that he&#039;s changed. His dueling style has changed from spamming action cards to spamming action cards with extra deck spamming on top, it&#039;s not fun to watch. He&#039;s like if Medaka was written to be a legitimate character instead of parodying talk-no-jutsu <br />
<br />
Yuri- Originally his character is extremely entertaining as he has his own twisted style of entertainment dueling which makes him really sadistic and provides umph to whatever he does. Unfortunately he shows up too little for that personality to evolve apart from his final duel with Yuya in which you finally see desperation from him. After the Zarc incident his personality has a complete 180 and now he is Yuya&#039;s best buddy, unfortunately that&#039;s all we see as he barely speaks at the end of the show.<br />
<br />
Yuto- A nicer Shun, I would&#039;ve like to have known more about him if he didn&#039;t die like 2 episodes in.<br />
<br />
Yugo- Pretty fun dude to watch, probably has the most normal personality of the Yu-boys as he doesn&#039;t swing one was or another on the insanity scale, he&#039;s just a nice dude who likes dueling while relying on luck (like Joey) and looking up girls skirts, possibly one of the most relatable characters in the show, which is nice.<br />
<br />
Yuzu- Starts off as a developing duelist with a kind personality but strong dueling skills, she shows promise as a better Asuka but then proceeds to turn into Yuya.Wav as she constantly howls Yuya&#039;s name like she is about to climax.<br />
<br />
Serena- I do not see the appeal of this character, she&#039;s a strong duelist with strong ideals on how duels should be properly fought, that&#039;s it though, she can be kind at times but she seems like a walking robot the rest of it. They try and shoehorn in some sort of relationship with Yuri at the end even though they have never even interacted.<br />
<br />
Ruri- I dunno, seems like a nice girl who wanted to bang Yuto, maybe if the show remembered that she existed then maybe we would know more.<br />
<br />
Rin- *burp*<br />
<br />
Gongenzaka- One of the few good characters, he is shown to be a character who is extremely loyal to Yuya but also holds him back when necessary, an extremely level headed character who sticks by is dueling method no matter what which provided for a very entertaining duel of beliefs. His personality developed to be very excepting of entertainment dueling even though originally showed distaste for when Dennis did it. Overall a fun character to watch as is personality is consistent but not to the point where it&#039;s boring.<br />
<br />
Sawatari- Oh boy where do I start. I&#039;ve never watched a show and felt bad for liking my favourite character until now. While being the only person who is actually good at entertainment dueling, he is extremely underused and treated like absolute trash. His W/L record is so bad to the point where his only 1 on 1 win was against one of his lackeys in episode 7, that duel wasn&#039;t even fully shown. He starts off as an arrogant punk who just cares about doing whatever it takes to win (which is ironic as all he ever does is lose) but after is first duel with Yuya and his duel with Yuto his thirst for victory dies down a bit and he begins to translate his arrogance into something that would shine really well, entertainment dueling. He develops a bromance with Crow which comes completely out of left field, however Crows death shows Sawatari that his actions can have consequences, which is a first for him. The rest of his screen time is him being a narrator of duels or him losing to some brand new character to show off how &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;strong&quot; they are when in reality putting these new characters against someone who always loses will mean nothing after a while. It&#039;s almost like the writers forgot to write him into the script and the animators were like &quot;Oh crap! Sawatari is in this show isn&#039;t he!? Let&#039;s just draw him in over there.&quot; It&#039;s actually insulting for someone who was built up as a more equal rival than the actual rival is tossed aside to be a butt-monkey, Sawatari is the embodiment of Arc-V, wasted potential. <br />
<br />
Tsukikage- It&#039;s like they took Gong&#039;s dueling ideals and put it into a character and turned that character into a ninja. You need an actual personality to be good. Tsukikage is just plain boring.<br />
<br />
Shun- How can so many fans flock around a character who can turn any semblance of personality into something more lifeless than my dead granddad is beyond my knowledge. However people will defend Shun &#039;till the Raidraptors come home. He has the same goal as Yuto but comes off as much more of an asshole while still coming off as extremely boring at the same time. There&#039;s some great conflict between him and Sora but in the end he&#039;s just a husk of a character. <br />
<br />
Dennis- Pretty good character honestly, starts off as a nice Yusho clone but then begins to show his darker side which was a great twist as he was a very mysterious character, he then has a crisis when dueling Yusho then cards himself. Then proceeds to have a 180 personality change which wasn&#039;t my taste but I can see the appeal.<br />
<br />
Reira- Starts off great with her timid personality and it gets even better when you see hints of an abused past. Unfortunately I can&#039;t remember anything else about Reira. Baby Reira is stupid and honestly a waste of space though.<br />
<br />
Reiji- I&#039;ve honest to good never seen a more boring rival in Yu-Gi-Oh. Heck, I don&#039;t even see him as a rival, I see him more as a mentor, he was never once equal with Yuya yet they still tried to market him as a rival, he wasn&#039;t even a good rival, he suffers yet again from the Mr. Boring trope and all he ever does is spew Keikaku. He&#039;s a bad rival and should have never been marketed as such.<br />
<br />
Roger- Great villain, probably one of the best characters in Arc-V, he starts off as a smug guy who thinks everything is going according to plan but it then shows that he is in way over his head and starts breaking down when characters are able to out think him, really fun to watch, wish we could&#039;ve seen more of him later on.<br />
<br />
Crow- It&#039;s Crow, he&#039;s a crappy generic character and just exists for Blackwings, all he does is shaft other characters to the side so they can shill more Blackwings.<br />
<br />
Jack- Watch 5D&#039;s if you want a good portrayal of Jack because this one is pretty uninteresting.<br />
<br />
Sora- At the start Sora was a great villain, he starts off as a strong duelist who seems to be on the side of good, but then his demented personality begins to show in his duel with Shun which shows how overwhelming his sense of superiority is, however he doesn&#039;t let this get over his head as he still respects Yuri. He then unfortunately, just like many characters in the show, does a complete 180 and is suddenly all hunky dory with everyone, it was at that point I stopped caring about Sora.<br />
<br />
Shivers Kid- Die.<br />
<br />
I wrote less on the legacy characters (only the ones that matter anyway) because they already hog up too much of the show, they ain&#039;t hogging up this.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 4-<br />
I enjoyed watching the Miami championship and the Synchro arc, however everything else was a pain to get through and the fact that it watched it weekly made that fact even worse. It got to the point where I didn&#039;t care what happened unless Sawatari showed up and even then I&#039;d leave with a sour taste in my mouth because he&#039;d always lose.<br />
<br />
Overall 3-<br />
Yu-Gi-Oh Arc-V is the definition of a train wreck. Next to no plot points were ended in a satisfying manner if at all. All the Arc-V characters were shafted aside by legacy characters meaning that even though those characters have great counterparts in their respectful series, Arc-V just has a pile of half baked characters that I never want to see again. Overall I&#039;m giving it a 3 because the amount of positives cannot even hope to touch the insurmountable amount of negatives that Arc-V left in your kitchen. I just home Vrains doesn&#039;t get the same treatment. <br />
If I could sum up Arc-V, it would be....<br />
<br />
                                ACTION DUEL! EGAORATION!!!!

    Let’s be honest guys, not everyone was happy about Yu-Gi-Oh! ZeXal. While the show was an overall critical and commercial success, some older fans felt alienated by it. And I can see why, what with the seemingly more childish tone (It wasn’t, sure, but the art style certainly gave off that impression) and a somewhat irritating protagonist. So as such, Studio Gallop brought back 5D’s’ director to try and bring in older audiences while still appeasing to the new crowd.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the result was the single most hated Yu-Gi-Oh! series in Japan, and America wasn’t much kinder to it after a while. That my friends, is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302065">
        Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.<br />
<br />
I should start off by saying that dividing when a story arc starts and ends in this show is a nightmare. The Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki mostly divides them from when an Opening is replaced, however this can make Arcs start and end at awkward points. On the other hand, judging them by what’s in the plot makes some Arcs seem too short, so if you disagree with the way I divided these arcs, I’m sorry, but this is the best I could find.<br />
<br />
1st Arc: Pre-Miami Championship Arc (Episodes 1-26):<br />
<br />
To be fair, the show doesn’t start off that bad, in fact I’ll admit: The first 50 or so episodes of this show are surprisingly decent. Similar to the original Manga, it starts off with the right mix of mystery and slice of life stuff. We know that there’s something going on, however for now the cast doesn’t really have any reason to get involved nor do they know what is even going on.<br />
<br />
That said, it’s not as if this arc is perfect. Like with the original Manga, the quality of these stories is very much hit or miss. Sometimes it can be pretty decent and other times… not so much. Still though, it is mostly good.<br />
<br />
I will also admit that the characters all have good starting points. Yuya can be somewhat self-centered, but is still clearly a nice guy. Yuzu has a lot of room to grow as a Duelist, but clearly shows potential. Gongenzaka… is clearly not important but that won’t stop the show from trying to make us think he is.<br />
<br />
Then there’s Akaba Reiji, who is sometimes hailed as one of the best rivals in the franchise, and while I disagree, I can see why. Reiji has a weird mix of a survival of the fittest and end justifies the means mentalities, and overall it makes for a rather interesting character. My issues with him are moreso present later on down the line, but overall I do feel he’s one of this show’s best characters.<br />
<br />
However he’s not the best character. That honor goes to Kurosaki Shun. He’s initially introduced as a generally neutral force, clearly being against something, someone, but we don’t know who. He’s legitimately menacing, and as we’ll see later on, he does develop rather naturally. There’s also his partner Yuto, who had the potential to become one of the show’s best characters, but as we’ll see, they wasted him.<br />
<br />
Either way, Arc-V does start off strong. Let’s see if it can keep its momentum.<br />
<br />
2nd Arc: Miami Championship Arc (Episodes 27-53):<br />
<br />
This is Arc-V’s best arc. In some ways, it kinda reminds me of Hunter X Hunter’s Hunter Exam arc, specifically the last part: Both shows start off as a seemingly normal tournament arc, but then stuff goes to hell fast. Of course it’s nowhere near close that masterpiece, but this show does its own thing as well by showing us most of the Tournament while keeping things interesting by having all of the stuff having to do with the main plot relegated to the background, but still progressing at a reasonable pace. It also contains the show’s best Duel: Kurosaki Shun VS Shiunin Sora. I won’t spoil it, but all I’ll say is that it was freaking awesome.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it also plants the seeds for what would become the show’s biggest issues, but honestly they aren’t so bad in this particular arc. Yuto dying would cause issues down the line as its clear even in this arc he’s not entirely dead, but here it makes sense and it does help create mystery. It also helps progress the mystery of a mysterious force possessing Yuya, which later on would turn out to be kinda bland, but here it works just fine.<br />
<br />
It also introduces Best Girl Serena. This girl is a badass and I love most of her scenes, and she does have a very natural character arc that does play into her character flaws introduced early on. My only complaint with her is that her redemption arc is done a bit too quickly yet also slowly. Like, she finds out that she’s working for the wrong side very early on, yet she doesn’t super definitely find out until near the end. It also introduces Dennis, who’s just so fun that I love him. My only real issue with him is that the cast takes way too long to find out he’s a double agent and his redemption came kinda out of nowhere. Either way, I do like him.<br />
<br />
Okay, good job Arc-V. What’s next?<br />
<br />
3rd Arc: Friendship Cup Arc (Episodes 54-75):<br />
<br />
Oh right, the show started to suck.<br />
<br />
Okay, the Friendship Cup Arc isn’t that bad, but its issue is that it feels like padding. The main plot is put on hold for a good 20 or so episodes just for some other Tournament Arc. What’s worse is that this isn’t even the good kind of out of nowhere Tournament Arc, in which every Duel helps the characters Develop, most of the Duels in the first Round are filler!<br />
<br />
That said, I will give it this: This Arc is very good at world building. The Arc-V version of Neo Domino City is clearly not the same one as in 5D’s, and it does a great job at making it feel unique. Also, while most of the Duels are unremarkable filler, the arc does end on a high note with my second favorite Duel in this show: Kurosaki Shun Vs Dennis Mackfield (Yeah Shun got most of the best Duels. What can I say? Raid Raptors are awesome).<br />
<br />
As far as characters go, Yuto is put on standby for now and is instead replaced by Yugo (Who is weirdly enough played by the twin brother of Yuto’s Seiyuu. Weird, I know). If I could compare these two to anyone, then Yuto would be Roxas and Yugo would be Ventus. Whereas Yuto is a bit of a loner and moody, Yugo is happy and upbeat. My thoughts on these two are also similar to the characters I compared them to, as while I do like Yuto, Yugo is a character who I can see the appeal of, but I personally don’t care for. What’s worse is that Yugo had a lot of room to grow, but the guy gets no development whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Then there are the infamous Legacy Characters. Yes, this show decided to bring back characters from previous Yu-Gi-Oh! shows. Specifically this arc brings back Crow Hogan and Jack Atlas from 5D’s. While Jack is as great as always, there’s just too much of him. He gets to Duel Yuya three times (Once in this Arc, again in the next one, and then an out of nowhere round three in the last arc) and overall steals too much of the spotlight. Also, they never even once mention his love of Cup Ramen. Crow is even worse, being presented as unfairly powerful and stealing away the spotlight for better characters.<br />
<br />
So yeah, not the worst Arc ever, but not what I would call good.<br />
<br />
4th Arc: Friendship Cup Finals Arc (Episodes 76-99)<br />
<br />
This one is hard to judge. Technically speaking, it is better than the previous Arc as it does a lot more right, but it also does a lot more wrong too. On the one hand, the plot begins progressing again, characters get some development, and overall it is a more focused arc. On the other hand, the structure is all over the place (it once again tries to not be a standard tournament arc only to then suddenly switch back to being one just so Yuya can have his rematch with Jack), characters that should’ve gotten focused on don’t get any spotlight, and overall it’s just all over the place.<br />
<br />
Take for instance Serena. She gets a Duel with Yugo in which she gets a decent amount of development, however then she does absolutely nothing for the rest of the show. The same can be said about Yuzu, who barely gets to do anything after this arc. Kurosaki also gets thrown out of the plot halfway through for some reason, and Yugo has still not gotten a single bit of character development! What’s worse is that the arc pretends as if Yuya has grown by saying he’s now using his own words instead of those his father used, and while that is true, that isn’t his main character flaw anyways, and that flaw is never addressed.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, let’s talk about Roget, the big bad for this Arc. My thoughts on him are similar to those I have for Father Enrico Pucci from Stone Ocean. A villain the plot treats as if he’s really, really smart… but is actually really, REALLY dumb. Dude makes so many rookie mistakes it’s hard to take him seriously as a threat.<br />
<br />
So once again, not the worst Arc ever, but it’s not good either.<br />
<br />
5th Arc: Heartland City Arc (Episodes 100-111)<br />
<br />
Yeah this is a short Arc. On the one hand, that makes it hard to hate… on the other hand that just makes the flaws more obvious.<br />
<br />
So finally the main plot is back in the spotlight… the problem becomes the plot is pretty dumb once you stop and think about it. Like, the part about merging the Dimensions makes sense, but everything else… not so much. If anything, this arc feels like a person stopping at a gas station during a long travel. It’s necessary… but you don’t want to stay there too long. To give it credit, the setting does look pretty good.<br />
<br />
Sadly, this is where all of my issues with Yuya begin appearing. He is selfish, self-righteous, follows his father’s ideal to make people smile as if it’s the only thing that is correct in this world, and is also less so a character than a caricature. Basically, he’s Emiya Shirou without everything that made him a great character. What’s worse is that the way the plot is frames is so as Yuya is always in the right, which bother the ever living hell out of me, to say the least. Even worse is that this comes at the expense of Yuto’s character, who makes the damn good point that there’s no way to reason to Academia, yet Yuya just ignores his feeling for what he feels is right.<br />
<br />
Now how about those Legacy characters? Oh right, they suck too. Kaito goes through a rushed version of his character arc in ZeXal, Asuka is pointless and does absolutely nothing, but MAN is Edo the worst of them all. To put it bluntly: Remember the calm, cool yet also revenge driven while still kind-hearted Edo from GX? Well, Arc-V Edo is nothing like that. He’s immature, bratty, incompetent, and his redemption arc is just badly done. Basically, he sucks.<br />
<br />
So yeah, not that good all things considered, but it could be worse.<br />
<br />
6th Arc: Academia Arc (Episodes 112-135)<br />
<br />
Oh no, this is where that worse begins.<br />
<br />
Yup, the Arc that was so bad that the show’s ratings dropped like a bomb. And yeah, it’s just that bad. To start off with, there is way too much filler. Many of the Duels don’t amount to anything, and overall it just feels like a bunch of ads for new Cards. Also, the Cast is awfully misused. Barely anyone does anything of note, and overall the Arc feels empty, which it shouldn’t.<br />
<br />
However it’s with the characters that this arc falls apart. Dennis’ redemption Arc is extremely rushed; Rin and Ruri get no personality whatsoever, and my God was Akaba Leo a terrible villain. Let’s see, he’s a hypocrite, is never called out on his actions, and he just suddenly turns to the good guys side after a while with no explanation given. Ladies and gentlemen, one of the worst villains in the franchise!<br />
<br />
Hell, wanna know who this show’s best villain is? Yuri, Leo’s creepy underling. He’s legitimately menacing, competent, and is just plain batshit insane. He’s nowhere even close to being one of the franchise’s best villains, but it’s enough to at least make him better than all the other villains in this show.<br />
<br />
On the plus side, the big twist was pretty good, and the last Duel of the Arc (Yuya Vs Yuri) was pretty decent. Too bad it leads to:<br />
<br />
Final Arc: Supreme King Arc (Episodes 136-148):<br />
<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, the worst Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc yet (Maybe, I’ve put VRains On Hold for a while). Let’s see, the arc has absolutely no sense of pacing? Check. The characters are wasted? Check. The few characters that aren’t wasted get unsatisfying ends to their character Arcs? Double Check. This my friends, is every bad Shounen finale out there!<br />
<br />
The Villain isn’t much better. Zarc is kinda like Aŋra Mainyu before Hollow Ataraxia came out. He has an interesting backstory and concept… but has absolutely no personality. It’s even worse in Zarc’s case, as they build up to him like madmen… and then he’s effectively OTK’d. Whoops!<br />
<br />
Oh, and the finale sucks too. Acting as if everything’s fine when it really, REALLY isn’t. Basically, it’s just a bad arc.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
<br />
The show looks fine, I guess, but I can’t help but feel this is a downgrade from ZeXal. A particularly big issue is that the CGI just looks lifeless. At least ZeXal tried to make them look somewhat Cel Shaded, here they don’t even try. To make matters worse, most Duels rely on Action Cards, which are absolutely pointless and half the time are just generic. Basically, the show doesn’t look bad, but not great either.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
I mean, it is fine, but not that many tracks stood out to me. I think one of the few that did was Yuya’s theme, which was apropiately energetic and I liked it. As far as the Openings and Endings go, the only ones I cared for were “Future Fighter”, “Burn!” and “Light Of Hope”. The rest I really didn’t care for.<br />
<br />
Voice Acting:<br />
<br />
Yet again we have a kinda amateurish cast. To be fair, Ono Kensho does a good enough job as Yuya, but damn compared to most of his other performances, it falls flat. Same goes for Hoyosa Yoshimasa for Reiji, though admittedly to a lesser extent. In particular, Namikawa Daisuke wasn’t very good as Akaba Leo. The only performance that stood out to me was Kinjo Yamato as Kurosaki, who did a great job. Plus, it’s Nossan from Kyoryuger! How could you not love him!? Everyone else is middle of the road though. Just to mention the few names I recognized (And I mean from Anime as I do recognize some of these guys from their apparences in Live-Action stuff) we have Fuchigami Mai, Yuuki Aoi, Touchi Hiroki and Kakihara Tetsuya.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Yeah, I didn’t really like this show. It’s not that I hate it, but man was it a letdown. It had the potential to be the best show in the franchise, but it ended up being the worst of them all. I can only recommend it as a curiosity.<br />
<br />
Final Score: 4/10
