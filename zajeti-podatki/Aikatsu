    When I was first taught about &quot;idols&quot; as a child, we knew them as false gods. Then I started watching anime and I realized it&#039;s practically the same thing for Japan.<br />
<br />
*Original review of the first 50 episodes follows. For an overview of the rest, scroll down*<br />
<br />
Aikatsu! follows the idol trend of the past few years. These are shows about cute young girls singing and dancing that look like they&#039;re for young girls but are actually for grown men, only this time around it actually is for young girls (it has some periphery demographic, though). It follows a group of middle school friends led by Hoshimiya

          <span style="display: none;" id="review114387">
        Ichigo learning to become idols at Starlight Academy through various &quot;idol activities.&quot;<br />
<br />
But what are &quot;idol activities?&quot;<br />
<br />
Singing and dancing are definitely involved and, as one would expect, are the primary concern. But that&#039;s not all, oh no. Aikatsu! delves much further into the idol world than that which we see on the stage at concerts (and probably further than reality). These girls take long runs, chop down giant trees, scale mountains with their bare hands, and navigate trap-ridden haunted houses. I&#039;m not even exaggerating here, all of those things literally happen in the show. It&#039;s no thriller, but there are a few surprising times where you wonder where these girls get the strength and courage to face these obstacles.<br />
<br />
But being an idol isn&#039;t all about training your body, either. Being an idol is also an image and representation. When you become popular, you get fans, and you need to be sure you don&#039;t let those fans down; this fact is not ignored. There is a certain episode in which Ichigo becomes overly worried about making a good signature and being able to do it fast when it comes time for her to meet fans and sign things for them. The problem is that she forgets the &quot;meet fans&quot; part, and only focuses on the signing, a fact that is soon brought to her attention by a friend, making her realize that she had been letting fans down who not only wanted to get a signature, but also to simply see her face and talk to her a bit.<br />
<br />
Further, there&#039;s an image to maintain. This is a fine line that could have easily fallen into the territory of shaming non-perfect body types, and even arguably toes the line at best. When Christmas break comes and it&#039;s time for Ichigo to go home for a couple weeks, she can&#039;t resist her mother&#039;s cooking; she eats and eats and gets...big. The people around her are disappointed with her, but not because of her new shape; it is because of how she let herself go, how she allowed herself to be lazy and leave her idol activities at the door step when she came in.<br />
<br />
At 50 episodes, there&#039;s a lot of time to develop story and characters. As one might guess from the above, most of the story is episodic, but there is still a certain continuation to everything. New idols are introduced and have bigger roles in subsequent episodes, a lesson learned in one episode will continue to be put into practice throughout the show, and as our girls get ever more popular both in the academy and in the outside world, things get busier. There are times where we might see a string of slice-of-life episodes followed by a slightly more dramatic story arc, but these never come too suddenly to feel out of place. They start reasonably and end well, with the possible exception of one near the end where it seems as though idol units begin to grow on trees and the viewers are left wondering who belongs where and what this sub-group, should they actually exist, is even doing.<br />
<br />
Lead protagonist is Hoshimiya Ichigo, with main support Kiriya Aoi and Shibuki Ran. Ichigo is a cheerful girl, always happy, but not always very smart. She decides she wants to do something and she goes and does it, no hesitation. Sometimes things work out great. Other times they don&#039;t. She doesn&#039;t take these moments for granted, but she doesn&#039;t let them get her down; she bounces back, taking what she&#039;s learned and applying it for the future. She&#039;s the kind of character who just attracts other people to her.<br />
<br />
But she wouldn&#039;t be able to do that without such great friends. First up is Aoi, her childhood friend who showed Ichigo her first idol concert that made both want to be idols and convinced them to apply for Starlight Academy. Aoi is the &quot;idol professor.&quot; She knows everything about idols. No, really. Everything. She&#039;s also an idol herself and Ichigo&#039;s #1 fan and as such, knows how to keep the peppy blonde in check...while occasionally succumbing to the craziness herself.<br />
<br />
And then there&#039;s Ran, the most mature member of the trio. She is first introduced as being popular around the academy for her cold, no-smile demeanor, having a confidence built up due to having years of entertainment experience under her belt before having even entered Starlight Academy. Getting her to warm up to Ichigo and Aoi was not easy, but when she finally allowed them to break the ice with her, we see what is really a very calm and caring personality and an irreplaceable source of confidence, even if she is sometimes the one who needs it the most.<br />
<br />
But there are a lot of characters here. Kanzaki Mizuki, the aloof and mysterious upperclassman and most popular idol at the academy who only very rarely shows a more emotional side (but don&#039;t worry, she does) is the most prominent support. She is the endgame, the goal everyone else is trying to reach, but a rival that always moving ever forward. A lot about her is left in mystery, but we&#039;re also given a lot of tidbits that show her to not be the 100% perfect being she&#039;s made out to be, and she never lets up, considering that, while she provides motivation for others, those behind her are also what motivates her to keep going.<br />
<br />
But again, there are a lot of characters, many of whom don&#039;t really get a chance to be fully realized. The extra idols with recurring parts, which include Otome, Yurika, Shion, Sakura, and Kaede, largely fall into this group. All of them at least an episode or two dedicated to their development, but afterwards they occasionally may make things feel too crowded and will largely stick to their base personality for the rest of the show without ever really being focused on again. It&#039;s a bit of a shame, but it was a trade-off for the extra focus on the show&#039;s main group.<br />
<br />
However, the show doesn&#039;t ignore any characters. There are multiple side characters who could easily have been left by the wayside but get their time in the spotlight, such as dance instructor Johnny Bepp (who, yes, does play a pirate in one episode) and Ichigo&#039;s mother, father, and little brother. These sessions are largely abrupt, but short and sweet. They really help to develop the relationships all around, giving all the characters more depth, all while not sacrificing the main focus of the show.<br />
<br />
And what is the main focus of the show? What do you think is the main focus of a show about idols? Music!<br />
<br />
Oh, we&#039;re definitely treated to music in this show. Every single episode climaxes in a concert scene. It&#039;s not a different song every episode, but it is changed up enough that by the time you begin to grow tired of a song, they start using a new one. Also, the first ED, Calendar Girl, is amazing and actually well portrays the show&#039;s eventual theme. Overall, though, while even Aikatsu!, like others of its kind, may seem to occasionally throw in more songs to advertise new singles, it never really feels out of place within the context of the show because most of what the characters are doing are related to their job as idols and leads up to the eventual musical piece.<br />
<br />
But speaking of those concerts and advertising...there are some weird things going on.<br />
<br />
One can&#039;t write a review of Aikatsu! without mentioning the forbidden fruit of commercial anime: cards. Aikatsu! too wants to sell you some cards. In the show, these cards are their outfits and are...generated?...in the Aikatsu machine for the concerts. Yeah, it&#039;s weird, but it doesn&#039;t tiptoe around it. Much effort is spent on matching up each member&#039;s outfit with everyone else and getting new cards for new outfits to fit a different occasion, including the special &quot;premium&quot; cards that are only given to the most worthy of idols. At the end of the day, it&#039;s hard to say if this was purely an advertisement gimmick, a legitimate-if-strange part of the story, or something in between.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s also this thing they do during concerts called &quot;special appeal.&quot; It&#039;s hard to even describe what these are since it really isn&#039;t grounded in reality at all, but it&#039;s this mid-concert thing that typically only takes a few seconds to do and ranges from spinning around wildly to shooting a heart with an arrow. They&#039;re supposed to be these things that make a concert and performer more impressive in some way, but it&#039;s never made clear what the actual purpose of them is or why they exist at all. There&#039;s even an episode focused on them, but all we really learn is that most idols can only do 1 per concert while Mizuki can pull off 3. Around the halfway point of the show they&#039;re never really brought up again, but they still appear in the concerts.<br />
<br />
Things are very pretty (and pink) in Aikatsu! land, but a little rough around the edges. Character designs are distinct and animation is typically fluid, but at the forefront of every episode&#039;s concert is a sequence of re-used animation where the girls are inserting their Aikatsu cards into the Aikatsu machine. The concert scenes are all in CGI, which can be a bit daunting next to the 2d animation of the rest of the show (which sometimes even appears for the audience during concerts). A quick eye can see commonly re-used background characters, not really a problem in most cases since I also see the same people every day at school, but the worst offender is a particular scene where the headmistress is addressing an assembly of girls and the two halves, hair color aside, are mirrored, like each girl has a twin sitting in the same position but on the other side of the room.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, Aikatsu! is just a happy show. Its run time is used very well, as it doesn&#039;t have to crank out material before its inevitable end and viewers are given plenty of time to get attached to the characters without having to leave them so soon. Certain episodes later on in the show really wouldn&#039;t have even worked without the kind of run time this show had; the impact they made just wouldn&#039;t be the same in a short series.<br />
<br />
Aikatsu! is also not for everyone. It is a kid&#039;s show and even fans who usually like idol shows such as Love Live and Idolm@ster may not be able to get the same enjoyment from this one. Feel free to judge this one by its cover; if a group of young girls in frilly dresses over a pink background doesn&#039;t seem like your kind of show, don&#039;t watch it. But if you do like this kind of stuff, or just feel like giving it a shot, you ought to like what you come in for.<br />
<br />
***The rest of it***<br />
<br />
And then there was more. And more. And then a little bit more. But I&#039;ll make this quick.<br />
<br />
Season 2 of Aikatsu, episodes 51-101, aka the dark ages of Aikatsu. Dream Academy, a rival school, is introduced, and with it the most frustrating time for Aikatsu fans. The new characters are poorly developed and seem to be way too talented right out the gate. Where the first season was fine with having characters lose, suddenly we see a bunch of ties happening. There are, however, good episodes in all this. Oozora Akari is introduced midway through and is immediately lovable, overturning everything bad in the rest of the season. Basically, any episode that doesn&#039;t have a great focus on Dream Academy characters is at least decent.<br />
<br />
Season 3 of Aikatsu, episodes 102-153 (somewhere around there, anyway), the Akari generation. There is a new protagonist, and while the old cast is still around, they are now side characters. The producers seem to have realized that everyone hated Dream Academy and more or less dropped them from the show entirely (they appear maybe 3 or 4 more times for the remaining duration of the show). The show goes back to its roots and, despite having a few more rough patches than before, is once again the Aikatsu we know and love (if you&#039;ve gotten this far, you must love it). <br />
<br />
Season 4 of Aikatsu, episodes 154-end, the...actually, it&#039;s just more of the Akari generation. Which is good! They didn&#039;t fall into the season 2 pitfall for the climax. And the actual climax itself was pretty great, being a story arc that lasted longer than any other since the one that capped off the first season and was a great way to end the series.<br />
<br />
Season 1, the first 50 episodes (and the movie, which was amazing), remains my favorite era of Aikatsu, but the last year and a half were certainly a worthy addition. At its best, Aikatsu was lovable, heartwarming, and maybe even a little tear-jerking. At its worst, I was shouting &quot;NO! NO! NO!&quot; at the screen in frustration. It had its ups and downs, but in the end it&#039;s become a series very close to my heart. I will miss the girls of Starlight Academy.

    Aikatsu! - Accumulation<br />
<br />
You know the drill. As usual, this is not exactly a review in the conventional sense, as it mostly focuses on analyzing the series as a whole rather than acting as an advertisement or recommendation to entice somebody to try the series out.<br />
<br />
**This “review” is SPOILER-HEAVY and is recommended for those who have already completed the series. A large number of events will be referred to and may be used as examples in various ways.**<br />
<br />
**This “review” will never be “complete” and I may be continually updating it in the future as I better collect more of my thoughts.**<br />
<br />
This analysis may be somewhat messily

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320832">
        written or seem to lack any sort of overarching structure. It is merely my personal thoughts and things I&#039;ve realized while watching the series. Everything is subject to change as my perspective towards the media I consume continues to evolve.<br />
<br />
Aikatsu! is easily one of the most refreshing titles that I have come across in a long time, shattering my expectations as for what I thought it would be, standing as possibly overall the most enjoyable anime I&#039;ve ever completed. After stagnating with the medium for quite some time, I felt that I had nearly entirely lost the ability to follow something continuously, yet upon cleaning up my plan to watch list, I realized that it only takes the correct title to get moving again.<br />
<br />
Something to note right off the bat is that, while the series boasts neither the greatest visuals, nor the most complex narrative, the original Aikatsu!, standing at a colossal 178-episodes with the added bonus of movies and whatnot, it is not quite the investment something like One Piece or Detective Conan would be, but it is a rather ambitious work to say the least, beginning on a much smaller scale as something simple, to follow Ichigo and her best friend, Aoi, embarking on the road to become top idols, yet as the series progresses, the cast dramatically expands to include dozens of familiar faces, both main characters and side characters alike, with focus distributed between many, nevertheless without ever compromising documentation of the journey of its primary protagonists. It is a children’s show which succeeds in impressing me, even in spite of having appreciated other strong titles geared towards the same demographic, and hence being less impressionable.<br />
<br />
The series’s greatest strengths lie with its characters, their interactions and development over a long span of time. This is not to say that Aikatsu! has the most complex characters out there, as many are still defined by common tropes or specific quirks, yet over time, many have their individual struggles both highlighted and explored and remain ever-present throughout its run. I found myself growing to enjoy the times when characters that I initially did not even like were centered upon, and on a similar note, at this point, I don’t think there is a singular cast member which I can point to and say I dislike. Of course, not every character is explored equally, but most of even the secondary protagonists are given some degree of spotlight and have their own following, if not playing into affecting the series’ universe in some notable way. Even characters as minor as Yuu have use made out of them in more than just one way, an example being her exchange student experience playing a role in shaping her to be a travel idol, allowing both Miyabi and Kotone to come to Starlight as a second function, with Yuu’s newfound motivation to further derived from her experiences of having Akari as her roommate. What I mean is that even characters that do not often appear generally are not outright wasted, or at least feel like they could take on some believable position in the Aikatsu world. Once again, the cast is massive and the series does a fairly good job of using members to point out different paths for idols in the same industry, not even specifically limited to the type of idol they are in terms of “cool” or “cute,” but in regards to the different branching routes sprouting from the same root, showing a split between things such as acting, modelling and comedy, and even specialties in regards to skill sets with Sumire’s singing and Rin’s dancing being their emphasis or even having Yurika explore the idea of idols taking on a character and sticking to it. “Everyone moves at different paces” is a common motif present throughout the show, and from this it seems that everyone also moves in their own direction. The way that characters continue to evolve and how their screen presence slowly gains weight over the years are part of what makes the show “work.” <br />
<br />
The “journey’ of Aikatsu! in itself is much of the point, and by this, much of what appears as tangential manages to merge together in memory to construct said journey, which in turn assists in fleshing out the characters’ own experiences. One could say that some leads end up going nowhere in reference to the long-term, bigger picture, yet it is precisely because Aikatsu! dedicates such a massive sum of episodes to focus on such a variety of things concerning myriad characters and encompassing different messages and experiences that the journey is formed as a cohesive whole to begin with. There is an episode leading up to graduation which emphasizes the memorable experiences of the past years as Ichigo and company are put in charge of organizing pictures. This is only possible due to seemingly one-off episodes and the multitude of experiences built up to this point, and this is even further supplemented as the episode continues to reference events which occur “off-screen,” which allows the viewer to sort of fill in the blanks themselves as for how things had gone. Something as simple as Aoi making a collection of all the pictures of Otome falling into the fountain for example, serves to illustrate the amount of time that has passed, given how long it would take to assemble such a collection. Similarly, the way that characters are able to actively reminisce on past experiences underlines the “gravity” of this time to them. They, themselves show a degree of awareness of the things they have undergone, and experience is not simply forgotten. Instead, it accumulates, much like its good episodes do, to form something larger than the sum of its parts. In this regard, Aikatsu! certainly is not the only show which does this, as other works which manage to feel like an actual journey are mostly composed of the same, but I find the series’s mentality towards its progression to be particularly special. There are no tricks or traps here, no catches, simply large-scale, wholeheartedly straightforward, earnest progression and development. <br />
<br />
Characters frequently acknowledge just how long of a way they have yet to go, and are in turn, often shown in situations in which they attempt to improve upon themselves, sometimes taking drastic measures in order to do so as with Akari in attending Aikatsu Bootcamp. The show never skips out on its training montages; characters are given ample scenes of preparation work ranging from dancing and choreography to vocal practice to concert planning as well as of course, the staple physical exercise. There are also many episodes in which characters attempt to acquire premium dresses, often revealing their dedication and desperation. Many indeed struggle with this from the get-go, but over time, one can note how much of a change has occurred, as such activities are no longer a struggle, and instead become natural. Soleil notes at one point that they instinctively all break into training upon meeting up with one another due to just how frequent of an occurrence it is. As a result, scenes of characters improving their physical abilities really play into the “weight” of their progress. The viewer can after a while, undoubtedly really feel the impact of progression and character struggles simultaneously feel earned and realized.<br />
<br />
There is also a certain self-awareness of one’s own progress, a shared spirit of characters always wanting to further themselves, even in cases of when one seemingly rises to the pinnacle of what is possible in their profession as with Mizuki. Her role in the second season of the show highlights the aforementioned desire to move beyond, and after holding status of number one idol for years, keeping up with her activities and defending her position, she is motivated to transcend what she has accomplished to not only be the current number one idol, but beat out Masquerade for the spot of number one idol of all time, through staging an event on an even larger scale than her predecessors. This sense of a continual desire to improve is once again, shared by essentially every other cast member as well, and characters almost never pass up on any opportunities to get their name out or perform, taking every chance they can in order to elevate themselves to the next level. Akari tries out and succeeds at being a weather girl, and in this way, allows herself to become somewhat of a public figure, to the point where even the elderly and non-idol fans are able to recognize her. Even in cases of which characters are skeptical regarding their ability to win a position or take on the role of an idol, as with Kii in her transition from merely being a producer to actually performing on-stage too, characters are able to ground their footing, Kii gaining confidence through winning as the poster girl for Pon Pon Crepe, and take on tasks they previously would not be motivated for. This is a large factor from which enjoyment can be derived, the series playing out almost more akin to a sports show, characters competing against one another in a sort of rivalry while also holding to a sense of communal friendship, boosting each other up and wishing for others’ success even when it means they, themselves would need to try harder in response. In fact, this dynamic of having to work harder in response plays into things as well, as it creates a chain reaction in which characters are motivated and inspired by each other, resulting in a nearly boundless rise up the ranks.<br />
<br />
In line with the physical training that the characters undergo to improve themselves, I feel that Aikatsu! is at its best with it more reflective segments. With most episodes, there is usually a point in time, be it a thoughtful conversation at the end after a performance, or a revelation to call upon newfound strength in the middle of an episode, which complements the physical development with growth more on the mental side. The small epiphanies, lessons and conversations and pile up to slowly affect how characters think and act, and in the same vein, these realizations are always diverse and tackle subjects that would be relevant for the characters to consider. A lot of the time, Aikatsu! may not necessarily give a clear-cut solidified answer to a specific problem, but its responses feels sincere and assist in providing catharsis. There is a moment in a large sum of episodes, usually towards the end before cutting to the ED, in which things just feel like they “click together” and said catharsis is felt. This is not the first time that things come together in this way of course, given that there are plenty of anime which manage to provide similar catharsis at certain points in their run, yet something that lies as a bit of separation is how Aikatsu! manages this consistently, on a seemingly regular basis. This ties back to what I mentioned before, of “good” accumulating to form something greater, and the series is a perfect example of something that embodies this idea. The journey is composed of combined experiences and everything gained along the way. <br />
<br />
Something else that Aikatsu! excels at is capturing how time passes. The show has a talent for having time pass in a matter of seconds while having that time have a sense of weight behind it. Even short scenes of the cast training or playing around over a matter of seconds are able to communicate far more in terms of how much time would be spent. The series has the habit of having performances in nearly every single episode, and if not at the end of the episode like usual, they could take place in the very beginning. With this in mind through, Aikatsu! can consistently illustrate endeavors over the matter of days within the same episode, establishing the conflict to begin with, all the preparation work that comes with what has been established and then the conflict or event itself. There were many cases in which I would expect things to be spaced out more over the course of episodes, such as the early Starlight Queen Cups or important concerts, to which “sometimes” they are as with the final Starlight Queen Cup, but generally, Aikatsu! wastes no time and cuts straight to the chase, having everything wrap-up within the episode that it is established in. The fact that Aikatsu! can cover even entire days in a single episode is something that I feel is crucial for communicating the aforementioned “gravity” of things, to where the audience can really feel that time is moving by. The series actually has four distinct christmas episodes and a nearly equal number of episodes dedicated to New Years’, considering that it seems to have been airing in real-time, which also further reinforces this idea of time passing. By establishing these sort of landmark as well as how seasons and semesters pass on a regular basis, it causes the viewer to feel as if they actually been watching the show for four years even if they happened to binge it in actuality, and this also contributes to making the show feel absolutely massive in terms of what is covered. This too, helps make the journey feel even more like an actual journey.<br />
<br />
Jeez, this far into the review already and I have not even discussed specifics regarding the protagonists themselves. Ichigo and Akari are both excellent protagonists who undergo significant development throughout the show, albeit Ichigo’s may be less immediately noticeable as she contrasts from Akari in certain respects. The most significant of these is her seemingly natural affinity for being an idol, as sniffed out by Aoi in the first episode as she recommends Ichigo to join her in applying to Starlight. With the blood of one of Masquerade’s former members running through her, Ichigo feels almost superhuman compared to Akari, and while she does struggle, a lot of it may be a bit less blatant, often touching more on the mental side of the implications of becoming an idol and progressing rather than on baseline physical abilities. This is not to say that Ichigo does not show any physical struggle, as for example, an episode in the first season demonstrates her difficulty of staying in shape and restraining herself, but much plays more into as previously mentioned, consequences of both her aspirations and those around her. The core of her character remains one in the same as her spirit and energy shines through in her every action, yet by the end of the saga, one can tell that Ichigo has matured and grown. Comparing Ichigo from episode one and episodes beyond the movie, there are noticeable changes in aspects such as demeanor and confidence. She has achieved many feats and has almost become memorialized as an idol legend in some manner, in eventually defeating Mizuki and rising to the spot of top idol, as well as how well she has continued to influence the myriad people around her. It reaches the point where characters essentially worship her, and the effect of this legacy is felt all the more because the viewer has accompanied her throughout her rise to the top. <br />
<br />
It is an interesting feeling since many works more or less stop when characters achieve their primary goals, yet to go beyond that and see how their achievements have influenced things from thereon out is fascinating, and with this, Akari of course, the second main protagonist is one caught up in being influenced Ichigo. She definitely falls into the camp of the aforementioned worshipping of her, specifically being motivated to become an idol because of her, going as far as to introduce herself as Ichigo while applying to Starlight for the second time. Unlike Ichigo though, Akari does not have the natural idol affinity that Ichigo does, which Johnny Bepp outright explains to Ichigo in the second season. Akari demonstrates far more in terms of physical struggle, having to completely work herself into shape from nothing, practicing running everyday with singing and dancing abilities with much to be desired, and taking an eternity to be able to perform a special appeal. Akari showcases a fair amount of doubt regarding her abilities, early on being highly skeptical as to whether she is actually moving forwards anywhere. She certainly eventually does, but over a believable amount of time and with much skepticism. In comparison to Ichigo, it takes a long time to slowly ease into being an idol, but upon finally doing so, she grows to “shine with her own light,” something that Ichigo points out that she has. Being influenced by Ichigo, Akari is without a doubt similar in terms of attitude, though without apparent the superhumanness or ability to jump into nearly anything, she is forced to face things with pure determination, a characteristic noted by her parents at a young age. In this way, Akari’s ascension also comes with the unique weight of knowing that she began at rock-bottom. There is some  incredible emotional weight behind having both protagonists reach their given landmarks and by these points, the payoff always feels deserved.<br />
<br />
The other characters also add much flavor to interactions and despite exaggerated elements, can feel real enough to empathize with; Johnny Bepp will probably stick in viewer’s minds with his trademark mixed english sentences and over the top attitude, even having some episodes dedicated to him, and he, along with other characters, provide the show with a very specific flavor of energy. He is given his own past as choreographer and teacher for Ringo and Orihime, Mizuki and the many students at Starlight, as well as fleshed out as previously being part of a dance group with Sonny. Orihime herself is fleshed out in her past being rooted in being part of Masquerade, and moving on to raise idols to populate the idol scene, her approach with Starlight contrasting from Tiara’s with Dream Academy in raising only the talented on a strict path of being an idol versus having even options of becoming a producer or designer open to anybody determined enough. The large number of idols makes up the majority of the main cast, and provide unique directions for the show to focus upon and adds some semblance of spice to it in their own way, with much in the way of character chemistry. Most of the time, even while embodying common tropes, characters stick to grounded struggles and have secondary attributes, for example Mikuru pursuing gardening on the side, which causes them to feel more like “people” On the other hand, various family members and supporting cast members provide much needed, well, support, for their respective idols to further help them feel closer to believable people with actual lives. Characters such as the many top designers also assist in making the Aikatsu world feel more like a living, breathing entity, featuring the diverse tastes and directions that various brands can tackle, and even showcasing the upward climb to being a top designer in the case of Sena, and the struggle to continue to churn out great work in the case of Amahane. The show dedicates a number of episodes to these designers, many of which reappear in the show more than once, in places designers would logically go to seek inspiration, and in this way, they too feel like actual people to some extent despite more focus being put on the idols themselves.<br />
<br />
I feel that moving the initial cast to the taking on roles of side characters in favor of raising new protagonists is one of the most interesting writing decisions Aikatsu! has taken upon itself. The dynamic between the old and new cast is especially notable, with said former cast acting as mentors for the younger generation in a torch passing-esque manner. This causes both the characters they mentor, as well as themselves to grow even further heights, with Ichigo substituting place of Mizuki for Akari as Mizuki had been for herself. Akari is not the only younger character who benefits though as even Mikuru acts as a sort of mentor for Hinaki to some extent towards the end of the series leading up to the finale. Another implication of moving the old cast to side characters though is that it increases the “weight” behind their appearances in the show going forward. It can be all too easy to get used to the old cast being on-screen as the protagonists and after following them for over a hundred episodes, going through all they have gone through, by now, viewers should show some attachment to them. Having less frequent appearances causes the times when they do actually appear on-screen again to feel like special occasions. I could certainly feel the weight of characters’ appearances as this was an extremely rare case in which I genuinely missed the old cast. The distance makes all the difference, and having them in the background though just gives the show an extra weapon in its arsenal that it can employ to enhance episodes and treat the viewers later down the line. It is just such an interesting choice to have them move in this direction as most shows would essentially stop upon having their protagonist finish their “main story,” yet Aikatsu! runs with it and decides to keep going.<br />
<br />
Another aspect of Aikatsu! that I greatly appreciate is its general tendency to “remember itself.” The show manages to capitalize on even minor details to have them be referenced on a later occasion, or in some cases further expand upon them in a meaningful way. One example which stands out is the Aikatsu8 selection, in which Ichigo cements herself a position, yet both Aoi and Ran are excluded in favor of other Dream Academy girls, to which the eight were apparently decided via real-life popularity poll. I found it particularly interesting that the show keeps remembering this detail, bringing it up in an episode of season three, being used to reinforce the aforementioned idea of how “everyone moves at their own pace,” having Luminas’ situation somewhat mirror what happened to Soleil in this case, and in turn simultaneously provides unexpectedly greater catharsis when the other members of Soleil can actually take part in the Aikatsu8 later on, all within the same episode. On another occasion, there was a scene where Sumire is shocked at the sight of dead fish, to which I assumed that the point of said scene was simply a comedic reaction, but the show then loops back around to reference this detail in yet another later episode, particularly bringing it in again as something that Akari and Hinaki attempt to surprise Sumire on their hidden camera show. Events such as the Pon Pon Crepe audition which is revealed early on as one of the first things Aoi participates in are brought back as Kii, and later, Akari, manage to participate in them as well, and with this, a sense of continuity is achieved. There are also things such as the “Angely Bear,” which Ichigo takes part in a commercial for in an earlier season. One would think that the episode works as a nice little one-off; Ichigo stars in a commercial and furthers herself by doing so, to which it does. However, the bear is later tied back to down the line in season four, in which Akari and friends work with Dandai in producing a new line of toys, Akari herself influenced by the Angely Bear commercial that Ichigo starred in, which inspires her to create idol dolls as well as have Dandai include the bear in the commercial. Akari’s experience of engaging in a talk show with Maguro is referenced as she attempts comedy upon encountering Nina, and Maguro himself appears more than once accompanied by Ichigo. There are countless examples of show the remembering itself, and things such as these demonstrate the chain of influence between characters as well as the show’s awareness of its own writing, and the fact that characters and their actions continue to come back, serve to have the Aikatsu universe. Mikuru’s promise to Mizuki is brought up and not forgotten, and neither is Ichigo’s statement of “waiting” for Akari in the Aikatsu! Movie. I love how Aikatsu! is seemingly self-conscious in being able to remember itself, to where even things that seemingly go nowhere on the surface have opportunities to be tied back to, in contrast to how most shows have things play out and then simply move onto the next thing. <br />
<br />
On a similar train of thought, there are many small things and recurring gags that the show seems to continue on, which demonstrates its capacity to remember and all in all just act as a nice touch. The “axe” becomes a running gag after being used in episode twelve to cut down a christmas tree, and from there it is brought up four more times in reference to it, with Akari, and even in the final episode. In fact, the idea of cutting and bringing back a tree for christmas is turned into somewhat of a tradition in this way. In a similar manner, there is a specific grin Ichigo keeps making in her performances, initially established somewhere in the second season, which permeates throughout the show, also appearing in the final episode while performing Calendar Girl. There are also the nicknames that Bepp uses, “Starmiya” being incorporated in the “Great Starmiya Ichigo Festival” and more specific things like conversation between Rin and Madoka towards the end of the final season, in which the two are playing shiritori, a japanese word game in which the player has to say a word which matches the final kana of the previous player’s word, to which previously established catchphrases are incorporated, and entire sentences of dialogue between the two still manage to follow the rules of shiritori, even after the game seemingly ends. These are just some examples of things that come to mind of course, but the show is full of stuff like this upon closer inspection. Once again, stuff like this helps demonstrate the show’s own self-consciousness.<br />
<br />
Moving on, Aikatsu! is far from the visually strongest work out there, but I would not say it looks terrible either. On one hand, some of the backgrounds, especially indoors when there are particularly dull-looking stock-image-esque walls, can be rather unappealing, though there are cases when characters are more outdoors where backgrounds can look more vibrant, colorful, and overall less plain, though of course things depend on the location and surrounding scenery. On the other hand, the characters themselves and foreground can look rather solid, with lines dark enough and thick enough to stand out. The CG dance scenes can be a mixed bag, as the early performances leading up to around episode nine can look cheap and downright atrocious, but from there after, Aikatsu! demonstrates a willingness to attempt to improve upon itself, the quality and expressiveness of said performances increasing drastically over time to be more engaging experiences. To the show’s credit, characters do go through quite an abundance of costumes, which are all showcased in their respective performances. In terms of animation, Aikatsu! is not the strongest candidate either, as many scenes are more on the static side as characters talk and fluid full-body animation is not always the most common while the show is in 2D, unless it is one of the movies, to which even some sakuga is included. However, Aikatsu! supplements its limited animation visually with its character expressiveness, applying facial expressions and reactions to its interactions to not feel dull.  <br />
<br />
Tonally, Aikatsu! is a particularly mixed show as it is unafraid to dive headfirst into jovial character interactions and activities or general goofiness, but simultaneously holds itself to having its cast genuinely consider their own self-improvement in a serious manner. The show feels like a nearly equal split between both, with many episodes of acting in plays or movies with things going crazy, most notably things such as an outer space mecha episode and the final magic card episode, to balance out segments with heavier emotional weight. It does things such as reference the lines of Ichigo and Akari at the beginning of each episode as a joke, and continues to do things in the same vein throughout. Typically though, Aikatsu! retains its positive upbeat attitude in some form throughout, regardless of what type of episode pops up. A lot of enjoyment can be derived from observing the casual banter between characters and how they ricochet off one another with a sense of rhythm just as an equal amount can be from watching the cast work towards and achieve their goals. With this, the series offers the best of both worlds, not compromising on either once again.<br />
<br />
Surely, for a show centered on idols and their performances, music should be a rather important element, and while I do not love every single song, I would say that Aikatsu!’s music is generally very pleasant. The performances themselves have some degree of variance in terms of music type chosen, slower songs to contrast faster ones, rock to juxtapose pop and whatnot. Some of Yurika’s and Sumire’s songs take on a more ominous feel while Madoka’s are far lighter and upbeat. Anyhow, the point stands that Aikatsu! does not fully embody any singular type of music, though generally much of its score pushes for its underlying positive energy. Music outside of the show’s actual performances though generally do a great job in enhancing its emotional intensity, aside from a few instances in the second season, playing the appropriate piece during important moments and providing much needed catharsis. The background music goes hand in hand with its character interactions to greatly influence the tone of its scenes and is a component that cannot be understated in regards to making the show “work.”<br />
<br />
Overall, Aikatsu! was quite the worthwhile experience and a joy to watch as a character journey over such a massive span of episodes. The collection of not only these episodes, but of these small elements, which makes Aikatsu! such a memorable show. I had found myself observing not only the character’s in the show attempting to improve, but show itself doing the same concerning its presentation and writing. Even characters who I did not like, I grew to appreciate, and even episodes I had expected to be boring I came out of surprised with what was accomplished. Though not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, Aikatsu! is something that offer a lot, and impresses me with its ambition and genuineness. Little else can leave me grinning like a retarded seal. :)

    There aren&#039;t many idol anime with over a hundred episodes, and there are even fewer idol anime that have the ability to hook and surprise you for such a long period of time. Coming in at just under two hundred episodes, Aikatsu is a series that manages to do both, and there are so many ways to describe it; energetic, revitalising, and optimistic, to name a few. But the best thing about Aikatsu is that it&#039;s able to toss its target audience aside and create something able to entertain people of all ages. Unlike Hollywood family movies or shows like Friendship is Magic, there isn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214958">
        much dumbing down or simplifying of the content within—it&#039;s effective, straightforward, and surprisingly realistic in its presentation. <br />
<br />
So what makes it different?<br />
<br />
The premise is straightforward: A school for female idols named Starlight Academy exists to seek out and train its kin, be it through acting, dancing, singing, or some other form of entertainment. Aside from an exceptionally kind headmistress and a few spunky teachers, there is no supervision or management to keep the girls in check; much like college, the primary reason for their attendance is so that they can discover who they are as a person (or idol) whilst remaining in an open social setting. Thanks to its believability, the concept itself provides you with many dramatic writing opportunities. Who are the students? What are their reasons for attending? Why are they all so interested in living a monolithic public life? These questions are regularly asked and answered, and their answers further the countless possibilities of the universe time after time. <br />
<br />
To bridge the gap between idol and school life, the staff always provides students with opportunities to get their name out and/or obtain new apparel, resulting in a rush of motivation for everyone involved. Depending on their popularity, idols can even influence the work of prominent and rising fashion designers or brands at large. Once the characters&#039; training cycle begins, the lurking element of surprise prevents you from taking your eyes off the screen. That&#039;s not to say it&#039;s all training and no action; the fun graces you one episode at a time, so the competitions, extracurricular activity, and other unspoilable events don&#039;t seem out of place for when their time comes. In other words, the occasional slices of life flow as naturally and beautifully as the show at large. <br />
<br />
One aspect I&#039;ve found to be unique to Aikatsu is its painless and beautiful sincerity; the characters have natural unbreakable bonds between one another, be they incandescent rivals or shimmering partners. It shies away from the trends of melodrama and grittiness by keeping things light and sometimes funny, completely aware of the fact that the most powerful emotional stirs are naturally-occurring. The cake is topped with a sprinkling of internal conflict, often pertaining to the difficulty of meeting one&#039;s own expectations. For a cast made up of teenage girls, they&#039;re delightfully headstrong and angst-free. That maturity spares you the clichéd nature of most conflicts within Idolm@ster and Love Live, and often gives you the opportunity to ask yourself the same questions. I truthfully believe the series is ultimately sociological, as is any great drama. <br />
<br />
That said, the show&#039;s composition resembles western TV dramas much more than it does your typical anime; the supporting characters are constantly evolving, changing roles, and moving into the picture, whilst the main characters themselves aren&#039;t as prominent as you may believe. Such traits are definitely not suited to everyone, but for anyone searching for more complex development, they are a dream come true. The continuity put on display here is fairly amazing—things you may haven&#039;t seen for dozens of episodes can slowly begin to reappear, and they always have a graceful fall into place. It doesn&#039;t sound so surprising on paper, but the practical appropriation of older content happens when you least expect it to. You&#039;ll want to trust me on this one.<br />
<br />
For the sake of performances, a fun little wardrobe transition to 3DCG is made whenever an idol needs to be on stage. But don&#039;t hold your breath! While the CG starts out on rocky ground, it goes out of its way to make some vast adjustments every few episodes. By the time you&#039;re a third of the way through, all of your gripes with its appearance will disappear. Still, it never stops making improvements, and things become increasingly gorgeous as you approach the final episode. The beauty of the CG is best illustrated during group performances, yet it also has some interesting tricks up its sleeve like flying objects and wireframe views that liven up the stage experience. Some incredible on-stage camerawork does a great job illustrating the benefits of using 3D animation, and definitely proves why the show chose to use the medium in the first place. I&#039;m not quite sure if the show could have retained the same energy without it. <br />
<br />
Finally, let&#039;s talk about the music. Some insert songs are impeccably composed and arranged,  others excel in one of those two departments, and the few songs leftover are straight-up bad. From a production standpoint, it&#039;s rather hit-or-miss, but the hits have the strength to absolve it of the misses. I even find the insert songs that are only okay to be a treat every once and a while, but due to the subjectivity of music, your personal results may vary. On the other hand, the background music is so subtle and relaxed that I doubt anyone could take issue with it. Heck, sometimes they&#039;re just little piano arrangements of prominent insert songs. It&#039;s definitely more consistent overall, and kind of sounds like something you&#039;d hear from a modern Nintendo game or device. Kind of perfect to do work to. <br />
<br />
Point is, this review may make it sound like I think Aikatsu is exceptional and near-flawless. That&#039;s because I do. I find its weaknesses completely redeemed by the underlying strengths. I find it able to appeal to any demographic without a hitch. I find it to be of a standard that all other kids&#039; anime should hope to achieve. If you&#039;re not sick of anime already, I would plead that you at least give it a shot. Otherwise, it&#039;s never anything remotely amazing, nor does it outright excel in any category; it was just enough to retain my interest in anime for much longer than I expected. <br />
<br />
And so as it decides to let go, I find myself doing the same.

    Although this anime has a bit of a slow start, the story is one of the better ones that I&#039;ve seen. Although it is a fairly typical coming-to-fame story, it is well done and unlike most anime that feel unfinished it keeps going until the story reaches a proper end. One very interesting thing is the cast collecting in the anime to the point that the main cast actually switches about halfway through. There are around 100 different characters and they each have interesting personalities, although some of them have unfortunately short screen times.<br />
<br />
The art of the main series is well done with the girls

          <span style="display: none;" id="review225326">
        being very cute and are all modeled differently, which is important for such a big cast. In the beginning the dance scenes are a bit of a problem since they&#039;re bad enough to feel like carcinogens, but that is fixed later in the show. The dance scenes are actually held in virtual reality in the show and when past recordings of dances are shown on screen they have the same animation as when they were first shown so it may be that their own technology is improving making the bad dance scenes slightly more forgivable. The dances at the end have better CGI than pretty much any other anime I&#039;ve seen.<br />
<br />
The music in this show is amazing. There is a total of over 70 songs and although there are both hits and misses the hits are amazing and many are top ten worthy, although partly due to the lack of insert songs in most anime. The voices were all outstanding. Oddly enough, the age gap between the seiyuu for the two protagonists is about the same as for their characters but in the opposite direction. All of the seiyuu do a good job and the ones who speak other languages add a bit of spice to the atmosphere. One character develops an even more cringe worthy version of Engrish, which is interesting to watch.<br />
<br />
With such a huge cast it&#039;s amazing that they gave every character an interesting and unique personality. There are even some characters who end up in the main cast who you wouldn&#039;t expect to because of their eccentric personality traits. The anime is about the characters and they all do a great job at making the anime fun to watch. There are sure to be some characters you won&#039;t like, but you can only hope that those characters won&#039;t get as much screen time. It&#039;s great to see the different characters from different places as they will often use this as a method for world development.<br />
<br />
With everything this anime does well it is incredibly enjoyable. As a kids show they try to decrease the character-viewer disconnect so anything the characters view as being good actually is good. There are some foods in the anime that just make you want to try them and some did have a limited availability in real life but none are available outside of Japan. Just like with anything it&#039;s more important who you&#039;re with than what you&#039;re doing so although this is just a really good rendition of a generic story the great characters and great music make it far better.<br />
<br />
With every considered this is a great anime that does not disappoint. There are still some questions unanswered, but they did a better job addressing the most probable questions than most anime do. Anime with futuristic settings are bound to have holes in their logic but this one does fit quite neatly. Whether if you like cute girls doing cute things, music anime, or even sports anime depending on your reason for doing so this should be a good anime to watch. As an original anime you don&#039;t have to worry about which episodes are filler even though the anime is on the longer side.
